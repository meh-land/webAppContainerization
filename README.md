# webAppContainerization

## First Commit
1. Created docker-compose that mainly contains what we need
2. Created a Dockerfile that contains all the images that needs creating
3. Added an entrypoint script that will be edited to my liking later
4. Created and tested an image that has both nodejs && npm installed (they run successfully)
